# Carbon Data Specification Scope v1.0

The Carbon Data Specification is a data dictionary for raw data and a standard for data requirements that enable energy data access for measuring, quantifying, and tracking carbon emissions from energy production and consumption. These standards and requirements should boost confidence in data sources, increase data utilization, promote scalability, and enable data aggregation for centralized platforms, which shall support and inform grid decarbonization pathways and decision-making.

* The Carbon Data Specifications Consortium (“CDS”) establishes specifications for the underlying measured / raw data needs used to calculate energy- and carbon-related metrics.   
* It specifies procedures and technical standards for accessing and enabling aggregation of the raw / measured energy and emissions source data, including recommendations for temporal scale, locational scale, timely acquisition, and quality assurance. 
* The power network-related metrics and raw data standards will be specified within the following categories:
    * Customer data. This may include, but is not limited to: 
        * Metering consumption and production data 
        * Account and bill data needed for project analysis
        * Authorization and consent processes
    * Power systems data. This may include, but is not limited to:
        * Power generation emissions
        * Delivery capacities and/or constraints
        * Generation mix 
        * Power imports and exports
        * Power market data
        * Contractual data

It is applicable to historical source data and metrics that support emissions based decision making and the measuring and tracking of carbon emissions. 

Any changes of Scope are not retroactive.
